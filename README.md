# WinForm2

I created this simple application because at that time, a feature in a web application being developed was intended to allow downloading PDF file documents.
However, this feature faced issues, preventing users from downloading PDF files for some time. 
While this problem was being resolved, I developed this application to make it easier for me to retrieve PDF files (stored as blobs in Oracle) based on user requests that had been saved in the MS SQL Server database.
hence the name is WinForm2. LOL
